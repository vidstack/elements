### Multiple Sources

The list of [supported media formats](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats)
varies from one browser to the other. You should either provide your video in a single format
that all the relevant browsers support, or provide multiple video sources in enough different
formats that all the browsers you need to support are covered.
