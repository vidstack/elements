Congratulations, you're done! You should see the media player rendered on your site :tada:

## Native Media Controls

By default, we'll remove the controls on the underlying `<audio>` or `<video>` element as we
expect a custom user interface (UI) to be presented. Set the `controls` property on the provider
component if you'd like to display the native UI controls like so:

{#if frameworkType === 'React'}

```jsx
<Video controls>
  <video controls></video>
</Video>
```

{:else}

```html
<vds-video controls>
  <video controls></video>
</vds-video>
```

{/if}

## Media Autoplay

We manually handle autoplay so we can detect when it fails. In addition, the `autoplay` attribute
will take priority over the `preload` attribute so media won't be lazy loaded.

Therefore, ensure you set `autoplay` on the provider component instead of the underlying media
element like so:

{#if frameworkType === 'React'}

```jsx
<Video autoplay>
  {/* Do not set autoplay on media element. */}
  <video></video>
</Video>
```

{:else}

```html
<vds-video autoplay>
  <!-- Do not set autoplay on media element. -->
  <video></video>
</vds-video>
```

{/if}

{#if providerType !== 'Audio'}

## Player Poster

You might've noticed that we declare two posters in the player markup. The one on the Vidstack
provider element is the poster that you expect your users to load and see. The other on the
`<video>` element is shown temporarily as the primary poster loads, or if JavaScript is disabled
by a client or crawler (i.e., search engine).

You can choose to load a low-res image that the user will see while the main poster is loading or
a `124x70` (or greater) sized image explicitly designed to show in search results.

See the [Structured Video Data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/video)
documentation by Google to learn how to explicitly provide rich information about your videos.

## Player Sizing

By default, the browser will use the [intrinsic size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Intrinsic_Size)
of the loaded media to set the dimensions of the provider. As media loads over the network,
the element will jump from the default `150px` width and `300px` height to the intrinsic media size,
triggering a layout shift which is a [poor user experience indicator](https://web.dev/cls) for
both your users and search engines (i.e., Google).

To avoid a layout shift, we recommend you fill `100%` of your media container and use an aspect
ratio container which holds a fixed ratio (e.g., `16/9`). Ideally the ratio set should match the
ratio of the media content itself (i.e., intrinsic aspect ratio).

Firstly, set the media and provider element's width to `100%` like so:

```css:copy
vds-media,
vds-video,
vds-hls {
  width: 100%;
}
```

Next, see our [`vds-aspect-ratio`](../../../components/ui/aspect-ratio/index.md) component for how
to set a fixed aspect ratio for your media content. Once complete, your media content should now
adapt responsively without a layout shift!

:::info
You may still see a layout shift if the `vds-aspect-ratio` component script is imported late.
Consider including it in your critical render path (e.g., in your root `App.*` file).

```js:title=App.*:copy
import '@vidstack/player/define/vds-aspect-ratio.js';
```

## Player Skins

You might be interested in a quick and beautiful look out of the box rather than
designing your own. Skins which provide what you're looking for are not available just yet but
on our roadmap. Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vidstackjs?lang=en) or
[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/7RGU7wvsu9) to be notified when it's ready.
